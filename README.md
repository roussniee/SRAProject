<h2>Description</h2>
I redesigned and implemented a modern solution to replace a legacy Microsoft Word-based request form. Using PowerApps, Power Automate, and Excel, I built a digital request form that reduced confusion, automated notifications, and ensured structured recordkeeping.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- PowerApps (form UI and validation)
- Power Automate (email distribution and file refresh)
- Active Directory integration
- Excel (employee lookup and request tracking)
- Stakeholder interviews for requirement gathering

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Met with stakeholders to identify pain points and define new form layout
- Built a PowerApp to dynamically populate employee info from AD/Excel
- Created a flow to automatically distribute requests to approvers
- Connected PowerApp to a SharePoint list for request centralization

<h2>âœ… Outcome</h2>

- Simplified request process and eliminated document-based versioning issues
- Ensured complete, accurate form submissions through validation rules
- Automated workflows saved time and improved accountability
